Task Management System
Description:
Create a basic web-based task management system where users can register, log in, and manage their tasks.

Features:

User Authentication:

Register: Allow users to create an account with a username, email, and password.
Login/Logout: Provide secure login and logout functionalities.
Dashboard:

Once logged in, users should see a dashboard displaying their tasks.
Users can add new tasks, edit existing tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks.
Task Management:

Each task should have fields such as task name, description, due date, priority level (low, medium, high), and status (pending, in-progress, completed).
Users can sort tasks based on due date, priority, or status.
Implement search functionality to allow users to search for specific tasks.
User Profile:

Users should have a profile page where they can view and edit their profile information (e.g., username, email).
Display user-specific statistics like the total number of tasks completed, pending tasks, etc.
Notifications:

Implement a notification system where users receive notifications/reminders for upcoming tasks or overdue tasks.
Responsive Design:

Ensure that the web application is mobile-responsive, allowing users to access and manage their tasks from various devices.
Technologies to Use:

Backend:

C# (.NET Core or .NET 5/6)
Entity Framework Core for database operations (SQL Server, SQLite, or any other database of your choice)
Authentication: ASP.NET Core Identity for user registration and authentication
Frontend:

ASP.NET Core MVC or Razor Pages for building the user interface
Bootstrap or any other CSS framework for styling and responsiveness
JavaScript/jQuery for client-side functionalities (e.g., form validation, dynamic UI elements)
Database:

Use a relational database like SQL Server, SQLite, or PostgreSQL to store user information and tasks.
Steps to Implement:

Set up the development environment with Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.
Create the project structure, including models for users and tasks.
Set up Entity Framework Core for database operations and create the necessary database tables.
Implement user authentication using ASP.NET Core Identity.
Develop CRUD operations for task management (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
Design and implement the user interface using ASP.NET Core MVC or Razor Pages with Bootstrap for styling.
Test the application thoroughly, ensuring all functionalities work as expected.
Deploy the web application to a hosting server or cloud platform (e.g., Azure, AWS) for public access.
By following this project idea, you'll gain experience in building a full-stack web application using C# and ASP.NET Core, focusing on user authentication, data management, and creating a responsive user interface.
